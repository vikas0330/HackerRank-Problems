'''Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. There is no limit in size as there is: 2^31-1(c++ int) or 2^63-1(C++ long long int).

As we know, the result of a^b grows really fast with increasing b.

Let's do some calculations on very large integers.

Task
Read four numbers, a, b, c, and d, and print the result of a^b + c^d.

Input Format
Integers a, b, c, and d are given on four separate lines, respectively.

Constraints
1<=a<=1000
1<=b<=1000
1<=c<=1000
1<=d<=1000
'''
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
d=int(input())
print(pow(a,b) + pow(c,d))
